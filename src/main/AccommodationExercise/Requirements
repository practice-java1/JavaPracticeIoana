    /* Create a **Accommodation** class representing a building, with these properties:
   - category (possible values: hotel, studio, pension, house)
   - price
   - city

   _Note_: you should use an `enum` for the values of category field.

   Create a **AccommodationRegistry** class, containing these _static_ methods
   (each receives a `List<Accommodation>` as an input parameter, and you need
   to decide on their return type):

      - **`categoriesCount()`** - returns the number of categories (of the
     actual accommodation, not all possible categories)

   - **`cityList()`** - returns the list of names of unique
     city, sorted alphabetically (hint: may use a Set; what
     implementation could you use to also help you with sorting?..)

   - **`averagePriceForOneCategory()`** - returns the average price for
     buildings from only one category (given as a 2nd input param to the method)
     - _Question: what should be the return type for this method?..
