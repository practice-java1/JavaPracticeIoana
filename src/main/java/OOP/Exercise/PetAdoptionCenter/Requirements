We will create a  application for a pet adoption center.
The main goal is to allow users to add pets for adoption and display the list of available pets.

Class Design:

Pet Class: This will be the base class, with common attributes and methods for all pets
(name, age, breed, weight).

Dog and Cat Classes: These will inherit from the Pet class and have specific
attributes or methods for dogs and cats.

AdoptionCenter Class: This class will manage a list of pets available for adoption, allowing us to add pets
and display the available ones.


OOP Concepts:

Encapsulation: Each class will have private attributes with getter and setter methods to protect the data.

Inheritance: The Dog and Cat classes will inherit from the Pet class, reusing common properties.

Polymorphism: We will show how to treat all pets in a generic way using polymorphism (e.g., having a list of Pet objects).

Methods: We will add methods to display pet information and manage the pet list in the adoption center.

Method to display the total number of animals in the center.
