-- Exercise: Online Shopping System --

-- Scenario --
You are designing an online shopping system where customers can browse and purchase different types of products.
The system should manage various product types, handle customer orders, and apply discounts based on product categories.

-- Requirements --
Encapsulation: Each product and customer should have properties and methods to access and modify these properties.
               Ensure that internal details are hidden from outside classes.

Inheritance: Create a base class for common properties and methods of products. Then, derive specific types of products from this base class.
             Similarly, create a base class for common customer properties and derived classes for different types of customers.

Polymorphism: Implement methods to calculate the total price of an order and apply discounts.
              These methods should work with different types of products and customers.

Abstraction: Use abstract classes and methods to define common interfaces for products and customers.
             Ensure that derived classes implement specific behaviors.

Clothes - 10% discount
Electronics - 20% discount

PremiumCustomer - 10% discount
