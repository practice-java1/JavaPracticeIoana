Exercise: Employee Hierarchy
Problem Statement:
Create a Java program to represent a hierarchy of employees in a company. You will have the following classes:

Employee (Base/Parent Class): Represents a generic employee with common attributes like name, employee ID, and salary.
Manager (Derived Class): A subclass of Employee, which includes an additional attribute for the department managed by the manager.
Developer (Derived Class): A subclass of Employee, which includes an additional attribute for the programming language the developer specializes in.
Each class should have appropriate methods for setting and getting values, as well as a method for displaying employee details.

To be implemented:
__-Create a base class Employee with attributes like name, employee ID, and salary. Include a method displayDetails() to display these attributes.

__-Create a subclass Manager that inherits from Employee.
Add an additional attribute for the department managed by the manager, and override the displayDetails() method to include this information.

__-Create a subclass Developer that also inherits from Employee.
Add an additional attribute for the programming language the developer specializes in, and override the displayDetails() method to include this information.

__-Write a Main class to create instances of Employee, Manager, and Developer, and test the program by calling the displayDetails() method for each object.
